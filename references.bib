              Identifying these causal genes would enable deeper understanding
              of the disease and assist in genetics-based drug development.
              Exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) are more expensive but can
              pinpoint causal genes offering high-yield drug targets, yet
              suffer from a high false-negative rate. Several algorithms have
              been developed to prioritize genes at GWAS loci, such as the
              Effector Index (Ei), Locus-2-Gene (L2G), Polygenic Prioritization
              score (PoPs), and Activity-by-Contact score (ABC) and it is not
              known if these algorithms can predict ExWAS findings from GWAS
              data. However, if this were the case, thousands of associated
              GWAS loci could potentially be resolved to causal genes. Here, we
              quantified the performance of these algorithms by evaluating
              their ability to identify ExWAS significant genes for nine
              traits. We found that Ei, L2G, and PoPs can identify ExWAS
              significant genes with high areas under the precision recall
              curve (Ei: 0.52, L2G: 0.37, PoPs: 0.18, ABC: 0.14). Furthermore,
              we found that for every unit increase in the normalized scores,
              there was an associated 1.3-4.6-fold increase in the odds of a
              gene reaching exome-wide significance (Ei: 4.6, L2G: 2.5, PoPs:
              2.1, ABC: 1.3). Overall, we found that Ei, L2G, and PoPs can
              anticipate ExWAS findings from widely available GWAS results.
              These techniques are therefore promising when well-powered ExWAS
              data are not readily available and can be used to anticipate

              disease risk through their effect on gene expression in different
              tissues. In order to understand the mechanisms driving a GWAS
              risk locus, it is helpful to determine which gene is affected in
              specific tissue types. For example, the relevant gene and tissue
              could play a role in the disease mechanism if the same variant
              responsible for a GWAS locus also affects gene expression.
              Identifying whether or not the same variant is causal in both
              GWASs and expression quantitative trail locus (eQTL) studies is
              challenging because of the uncertainty induced by linkage
              disequilibrium and the fact that some loci harbor multiple causal
              variants. However, current methods that address this problem

              Non-biomarker findings include associations between MC1R and red
              hair color and skin color, IL17RA and monocyte count, and IQGAP2
              and mean platelet volume. Finally, we apply MRP in a
              multi-phenotype setting; after clustering the 35 biomarker
              phenotypes based on genetic correlation estimates, we find that
              joint analysis of these phenotypes results in substantial power
              gains for gene-trait associations, such as in TNFRSF13B in one of
              the clusters containing diabetes- and lipid-related traits.
              Overall, we show that the MRP model comparison approach improves
              upon useful features from widely used meta-analysis approaches
              for rare-variant association analyses and prioritizes protective
              modifiers of disease risk.",

              analysis are popular computational approaches for integrating
              genetic-association data from molecular and complex traits. They
              show the unique ability to go beyond variant-level
              genetic-association evidence and implicate critical functional
              units, e.g., genes, in disease etiology. However, in practice,
              when the two approaches are applied to the same molecular and
              complex-trait data, the inference results can be markedly
              different. This paper systematically investigates the inferential
              reproducibility between the two approaches through theoretical
              derivation, numerical experiments, and analyses of four complex
              trait GWAS and GTEx eQTL data. We identify two classes of
              inconsistent inference results. We find that the first class of
              inconsistent results (i.e., genes with strong colocalization but
              weak transcriptome-wide association study [TWAS] signals) might
              suggest an interesting biological phenomenon, i.e., horizontal
              pleiotropy; thus, the two approaches are truly complementary. The
              inconsistency in the second class (i.e., genes with weak
              colocalization but strong TWAS signals) can be understood and
              effectively reconciled. To this end, we propose a computational
              approach for locus-level colocalization analysis. We demonstrate
              that the joint TWAS and locus-level colocalization analysis
              improves specificity and sensitivity for implicating biologically
              relevant genes.",

  abstract = "A major challenge of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is
              to translate phenotypic associations into biological insights.
              Here, we integrate a large GWAS on blood lipids involving 1.6
              million individuals from five ancestries with a wide array of
              functional genomic datasets to discover regulatory mechanisms
              underlying lipid associations. We first prioritize
              lipid-associated genes with expression quantitative trait locus
              (eQTL) colocalizations and then add chromatin interaction data to
              narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment
              analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell
              types confirms the central role of the liver in lipid levels and
              highlights the selective enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin
              marks in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides.
              Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding sites with
              lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology.
              In addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize
              causal variants at GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of
              candidate causal genes and variants with multiple layers of
              functional evidence. We highlight two of the prioritized genes,
              CREBRF and RRBP1, which show convergent evidence across

              of African, Hispanic/Latino, and European ancestry in the US and
              of Finnish ancestry in Finland (a population isolate). For each
              study, we performed genotype imputation by using the genetic
              variants present on the Illumina Core, OmniExpress, MEGA, and
              Omni 2.5M arrays with the 1000G, HRC, and TOPMed imputation
              reference panels. Using the Omni 2.5M array and the TOPMed panel,
              $\geq$90\% of bi-allelic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) are
              well imputed (r2 > 0.8) down to minor-allele frequencies (MAFs)

              difference in TOPMed-based imputation quality among the arrays

              widely between and within the three US studies. Imputation
              quality also varied across genomic regions, producing regions
              where even common (MAF > 5\%) variants were consistently not well
              imputed across ancestries. The extent to which array genotyping
              and imputation can approximate WGS therefore depends on reference

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Polygenic scores (PGSs), which assess the genetic
              risk of individuals for a disease, are calculated as a weighted
              count of risk alleles identified in genome-wide association
              studies. PGS methods differ in which DNA variants are included
              and the weights assigned to them; some require an independent
              tuning sample to help inform these choices. PGSs are evaluated in
              independent target cohorts with known disease status. Variability
              between target cohorts is observed in applications to real data
              sets, which could reflect a number of factors, e.g., phenotype
              definition or technical factors. METHODS: The Psychiatric
              Genomics Consortium Working Groups for schizophrenia and major
              depressive disorder bring together many independently collected
              case-control cohorts. We used these resources (31,328
              schizophrenia cases, 41,191 controls; 248,750 major depressive
              disorder cases, 563,184 controls) in repeated application of
              leave-one-cohort-out meta-analyses, each used to calculate and
              evaluate PGS in the left-out (target) cohort. Ten PGS methods
              (the baseline PC+T method and 9 methods that model genetic
              architecture more formally: SBLUP, LDpred2-Inf, LDpred-funct,
              LDpred2, Lassosum, PRS-CS, PRS-CS-auto, SBayesR, MegaPRS) were
              compared. RESULTS: Compared with PC+T, the other 9 methods gave
              higher prediction statistics, MegaPRS, LDPred2, and SBayesR
              significantly so, explaining up to 9.2\% variance in liability
              for schizophrenia across 30 target cohorts, an increase of 44\%.
              For major depressive disorder across 26 target cohorts, these
              statistics were 3.5\% and 59\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
              Although the methods that more formally model genetic
              architecture have similar performance, MegaPRS, LDpred2, and

              variants exert their effects on the traits are often unknown. We
              propose a method (called SMR) that integrates summary-level data
              from GWAS with data from expression quantitative trait locus
              (eQTL) studies to identify genes whose expression levels are
              associated with a complex trait because of pleiotropy. We apply
              the method to five human complex traits using GWAS data on up to
              339,224 individuals and eQTL data on 5,311 individuals, and we
              prioritize 126 genes (for example, TRAF1 and ANKRD55 for
              rheumatoid arthritis and SNX19 and NMRAL1 for schizophrenia), of
              which 25 genes are new candidates; 77 genes are not the nearest
              annotated gene to the top associated GWAS SNP. These genes
              provide important leads to design future functional studies to
              understand the mechanism whereby DNA variation leads to complex
              trait variation.",

              to elucidate the genetic architecture and biology of heart, lung,
              blood and sleep disorders, with the ultimate goal of improving
              diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases. The
              initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome
              sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse
              backgrounds. Here we describe the TOPMed goals and design as well
              as the available resources and early insights obtained from the
              sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a
              genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that
              are available through dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and
              Phenotypes)1. In the first 53,831 TOPMed samples, we detected
              more than 400 million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion
              variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional
              previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of
              unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci.
              Among the more than 400 million detected variants, 97\% have
              frequencies of less than 1\% and 46\% are singletons that are
              present in only one individual (53\% among unrelated
              individuals). These rare variants provide insights into
              mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The
              extensive catalogue of genetic variation in TOPMed studies
              provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of
              rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation.
              Furthermore, combining TOPMed haplotypes with modern imputation
              methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association
              studies to include variants down to a frequency of approximately
              0.01\%.",

              454,787 participants in the UK Biobank study2. We identified 12

              loss-of-function and around 1.8 million deleterious missense
              variants. When these were tested for association with 3,994
              health-related traits, we found 564 genes with trait associations
              at P $\leq$ 2.18 $\times$ 10-11. Rare variant associations were
              enriched in loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but
              most (91\%) were independent of common variant signals. We
              discovered several risk-increasing associations with traits
              related to liver disease, eye disease and cancer, among others,
              as well as risk-lowering associations for hypertension
              (SLC9A3R2), diabetes (MAP3K15, FAM234A) and asthma (SLC27A3). Six
              genes were associated with brain imaging phenotypes, including
              two involved in neural development (GBE1, PLD1). Of the signals
              available and powered for replication in an independent cohort,
              81\% were confirmed; furthermore, association signals were
              generally consistent across individuals of European, Asian and
              African ancestry. We illustrate the ability of exome sequencing

  abstract = "Detailed knowledge of how diversity in the sequence of the human
              genome affects phenotypic diversity depends on a comprehensive
              and reliable characterization of both sequences and phenotypic
              variation. Over the past decade, insights into this relationship
              have been obtained from whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome
              sequencing of large cohorts with rich phenotypic data1,2. Here we
              describe the analysis of whole-genome sequencing of 150,119
              individuals from the UK Biobank3. This constitutes a set of
              high-quality variants, including 585,040,410 single-nucleotide
              polymorphisms, representing 7.0\% of all possible human
              single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and 58,707,036 indels. This
              large set of variants allows us to characterize selection based
              on sequence variation within a population through a depletion
              rank score of windows along the genome. Depletion rank analysis
              shows that coding exons represent a small fraction of regions in
              the genome subject to strong sequence conservation. We define
              three cohorts within the UK Biobank: a large British Irish
              cohort, a smaller African cohort and a South Asian cohort. A
              haplotype reference panel is provided that allows reliable
              imputation of most variants carried by three or more sequenced
              individuals. We identified 895,055 structural variants and
              2,536,688 microsatellites, groups of variants typically excluded

              and common diseases. Genome-wide association studies have
              identified thousands of common-variant associations, and more
              recently, large-scale exome sequencing studies have identified
              rare-variant associations in hundreds of genes1-3. However,
              rare-variant genetic architecture is not well characterized, and
              the relationship between common-variant and rare-variant
              architecture is unclear4. Here we quantify the heritability
              explained by the gene-wise burden of rare coding variants across
              22 common traits and diseases in 394,783 UK Biobank exomes5. Rare
              coding variants (allele frequency < 1 $\times$ 10-3) explain
              1.3\% (s.e. = 0.03\%) of phenotypic variance on average-much less
              than common variants-and most burden heritability is explained by
              ultrarare loss-of-function variants (allele frequency < 1
              $\times$ 10-5). Common and rare variants implicate the same cell
              types, with similar enrichments, and they have pleiotropic
              effects on the same pairs of traits, with similar genetic
              correlations. They partially colocalize at individual genes and
              loci, but not to the same extent: burden heritability is strongly
              concentrated in significant genes, while common-variant
              heritability is more polygenic, and burden heritability is also
              more strongly concentrated in constrained genes. Finally, we find
              that burden heritability for schizophrenia and bipolar
              disorder6,7 is approximately 2\%. Our results indicate that rare
              coding variants will implicate a tractable number of large-effect
              genes, that common and rare associations are mechanistically
              convergent, and that rare coding variants will contribute only
              modestly to missing heritability and population risk
              stratification.",

              noncoding variants from which pinpointing causal genes remains
              challenging. Here we combined data from 718,734 individuals to
              discover rare and low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF) <
              5\%) coding variants associated with BMI. We identified 14 coding
              variants in 13 genes, of which 8 variants were in genes (ZBTB7B,
              ACHE, RAPGEF3, RAB21, ZFHX3, ENTPD6, ZFR2 and ZNF169) newly
              implicated in human obesity, 2 variants were in genes (MC4R and
              KSR2) previously observed to be mutated in extreme obesity and 2
              variants were in GIPR. The effect sizes of rare variants are ~10
              times larger than those of common variants, with the largest
              effect observed in carriers of an MC4R mutation introducing a
              stop codon (p.Tyr35Ter, MAF = 0.01\%), who weighed ~7 kg more
              than non-carriers. Pathway analyses based on the variants
              associated with BMI confirm enrichment of neuronal genes and
              provide new evidence for adipocyte and energy expenditure

              the enormous scale of the noncoding mutation space. We developed
              a deep learning-based framework, ExPecto, that can accurately
              predict, ab initio from a DNA sequence, the tissue-specific
              transcriptional effects of mutations, including those that are

              experimentally validated predictions for four immune-related

              8.8 million rare variants in 49 human tissues from the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset. At 20\% recall,
              state-of-the-art DNA-based models achieve maximum 12\% precision.
              By mapping and quantifying tissue-specific splice site usage
              transcriptome-wide and modeling isoform competition, we increased
              precision by threefold at the same recall. Integrating
              RNA-sequencing data of clinically accessible tissues into our
              model, AbSplice, brought precision to 60\%. These results,
              replicated in two independent cohorts, substantially contribute
              to noncoding loss-of-function variant identification and to
              genetic diagnostics design and analytics.",

               largely focused on insulin resistance in the fasting state,

               variants influencing insulin levels measured 2 h after a glucose
               challenge in >55,000 participants from three ancestry groups. We

              However, the target genes and cellular mechanisms driving such

              systematically identify the cellular programmes of one of the
              top-scoring MONW risk loci, the 2q24.3 risk locus, in
              subcutaneous adipocytes. We identify a causal genetic variant,
              rs6712203, an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism in the
              COBLL1 gene, which changes the conserved transcription factor
              motif of POU domain, class 2, transcription factor 2, and leads
              to differential COBLL1 gene expression by altering the enhancer
              activity at the locus in subcutaneous adipocytes. We then
              establish the cellular programme under the genetic control of the
              2q24.3 MONW risk locus and the effector gene COBLL1, which is
              characterized by impaired actin cytoskeleton remodelling in

              these cells to accumulate lipids and develop into metabolically

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) deficiency is the
              commonest monogenic form of obesity. However, the clinical
              spectrum and mode of inheritance have not been defined,
              pathophysiological mechanisms leading to obesity are poorly
              understood, and there is little information regarding
              genotype-phenotype correlations. METHODS: We determined the
              nucleotide sequence of the MC4R gene in 500 probands with severe
              childhood obesity. Family studies were undertaken to examine
              cosegregation of identified mutations with obesity. Subjects with
              MC4R deficiency underwent metabolic and endocrine evaluation; the
              results were correlated with the signaling properties of mutant
              receptors. RESULTS: Twenty-nine probands (5.8 percent) had
              mutations in MC4R; 23 were heterozygous, and 6 were homozygous.
              Mutation carriers had severe obesity, increased lean mass,
              increased linear growth, hyperphagia, and severe
              hyperinsulinemia; homozygotes were more severely affected than
              heterozygotes. Subjects with mutations retaining residual
              signaling capacity had a less severe phenotype. CONCLUSIONS:
              Mutations in MC4R result in a distinct obesity syndrome that is
              inherited in a codominant manner. Mutations leading to complete
              loss of function are associated with a more severe phenotype. The
              correlation between the signaling properties of these mutant
              receptors and energy intake emphasizes the key role of this
              receptor in the control of eating behavior in humans.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Genomewide association studies can be used to
              identify disease-relevant genomic regions, but interpretation of
              the data is challenging. The FTO region harbors the strongest
              genetic association with obesity, yet the mechanistic basis of
              this association remains elusive. METHODS: We examined epigenomic
              data, allelic activity, motif conservation, regulator expression,
              and gene coexpression patterns, with the aim of dissecting the
              regulatory circuitry and mechanistic basis of the association
              between the FTO region and obesity. We validated our predictions
              with the use of directed perturbations in samples from patients
              and from mice and with endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in
              samples from patients. RESULTS: Our data indicate that the FTO
              allele associated with obesity represses mitochondrial
              thermogenesis in adipocyte precursor cells in a tissue-autonomous
              manner. The rs1421085 T-to-C single-nucleotide variant disrupts a
              conserved motif for the ARID5B repressor, which leads to
              derepression of a potent preadipocyte enhancer and a doubling of
              IRX3 and IRX5 expression during early adipocyte differentiation.
              This results in a cell-autonomous developmental shift from
              energy-dissipating beige (brite) adipocytes to energy-storing
              white adipocytes, with a reduction in mitochondrial thermogenesis
              by a factor of 5, as well as an increase in lipid storage.
              Inhibition of Irx3 in adipose tissue in mice reduced body weight
              and increased energy dissipation without a change in physical
              activity or appetite. Knockdown of IRX3 or IRX5 in primary
              adipocytes from participants with the risk allele restored
              thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7, and overexpression
              of these genes had the opposite effect in adipocytes from
              nonrisk-allele carriers. Repair of the ARID5B motif by
              CRISPR-Cas9 editing of rs1421085 in primary adipocytes from a
              patient with the risk allele restored IRX3 and IRX5 repression,
              activated browning expression programs, and restored
              thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              results point to a pathway for adipocyte thermogenesis regulation
              involving ARID5B, rs1421085, IRX3, and IRX5, which, when
              manipulated, had pronounced pro-obesity and anti-obesity effects.

              weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as
              an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed.
              METHODS: In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with
              a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square
              of the height in meters) of 30 or greater ($\geq$27 in persons
              with $\geq$1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not
              have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68
              weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at
              a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The
              coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight
              and weight reduction of at least 5\%. The primary estimand (a
              precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the
              objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of
              treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions. RESULTS: The
              mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9\%
              in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4\% with placebo,
              for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points
              (95\% confidence interval [CI], -13.4 to -11.5; P<0.001). More
              participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group
              achieved weight reductions of 5\% or more (1047 participants
              [86.4\%] vs. 182 [31.5\%]), 10\% or more (838 [69.1\%] vs. 69
              [12.0\%]), and 15\% or more (612 [50.5\%] vs. 28 [4.9\%]) at week
              68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in
              body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the
              semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group
              (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95\% CI, -13.7 to
              -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater
              improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a
              greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning
              from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and
              diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide;
              they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity
              and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide
              group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to
              gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5\%] vs. 5 [0.8\%]). CONCLUSIONS:

              liver cirrhosis, providing a strategy for the discovery of new
              therapeutic targets. METHODS: We performed a multistage exome
              sequencing and genetic association analysis to identify genes in
              which rare protein-coding variants were associated with liver
              phenotypes. We conducted in vitro experiments to further
              characterize associations. RESULTS: The multistage analysis
              involved 542,904 persons with available data on liver
              aminotransferase levels, 24,944 patients with various types of
              liver disease, and 490,636 controls without liver disease. We
              found that rare coding variants in APOB, ABCB4, SLC30A10, and
              TM6SF2 were associated with increased aminotransferase levels and
              an increased risk of liver disease. We also found that variants
              in CIDEB, which encodes a structural protein found in hepatic
              lipid droplets, had a protective effect. The burden of rare
              predicted loss-of-function variants plus missense variants in
              CIDEB (combined carrier frequency, 0.7\%) was associated with
              decreased alanine aminotransferase levels (beta per allele, -1.24

              4.8$\times$10-9) and with 33\% lower odds of liver disease of any
              cause (odds ratio per allele, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.57 to 0.79; P =
              9.9$\times$10-7). Rare coding variants in CIDEB were associated
              with a decreased risk of liver disease across different
              underlying causes and different degrees of severity, including
              cirrhosis of any cause (odds ratio per allele, 0.50; 95\% CI,
              0.36 to 0.70). Among 3599 patients who had undergone bariatric
              surgery, rare coding variants in CIDEB were associated with a
              decreased nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (beta
              per allele in score units, -0.98; 95\% CI, -1.54 to -0.41 [scores
              range from 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating more severe
              disease]). In human hepatoma cell lines challenged with oleate,
              CIDEB small interfering RNA knockdown prevented the buildup of
              large lipid droplets. CONCLUSIONS: Rare germline mutations in

              polygenic scores based on summary statistics and a matrix of
              correlation between genetic variants. However, LDpred has
              limitations that may reduce its predictive performance. RESULTS:
              Here, we present LDpred2, a new version of LDpred that addresses
              these issues. We also provide two new options in LDpred2: a
              'sparse' option that can learn effects that are exactly 0, and an
              'auto' option that directly learns the two LDpred parameters from
              data. We benchmark predictive performance of LDpred2 against the

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Deep-learning models, such as convolutional neural
              networks, are able to accurately map biological sequences to
              associated functional readouts and properties by learning
              predictive de novo representations. In silico saturation
              mutagenesis (ISM) is a popular feature attribution technique for
              inferring contributions of all characters in an input sequence to
              the model's predicted output. The main drawback of ISM is its
              runtime, as it involves multiple forward propagations of all
              possible mutations of each character in the input sequence
              through the trained model to predict the effects on the output.
              RESULTS: We present fastISM, an algorithm that speeds up ISM by a
              factor of over 10$\times$ for commonly used convolutional neural
              network architectures. fastISM is based on the observations that
              the majority of computation in ISM is spent in convolutional
              layers, and a single mutation only disrupts a limited region of
              intermediate layers, rendering most computation redundant.
              fastISM reduces the gap between backpropagation-based feature
              attribution methods and ISM. It far surpasses the runtime of
              backpropagation-based methods on multi-output architectures,
              making it feasible to run ISM on a large number of sequences.

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Sparse regularized regression methods are now widely
              used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to address the
              multiple testing burden that limits discovery of potentially
              important predictors. Linear mixed models (LMMs) have become an
              attractive alternative to principal components (PCs) adjustment
              to account for population structure and relatedness in
              high-dimensional penalized models. However, their use in binary
              trait GWAS rely on the invalid assumption that the residual
              variance does not depend on the estimated regression
              coefficients. Moreover, LMMs use a single spectral decomposition
              of the covariance matrix of the responses, which is no longer
              possible in generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). RESULTS: We
              introduce a new method called pglmm, a penalized GLMM that allows
              to simultaneously select genetic markers and estimate their
              effects, accounting for between-individual correlations and
              binary nature of the trait. We develop a computationally
              efficient algorithm based on penalized quasi-likelihood
              estimation that allows to scale regularized mixed models on
              high-dimensional binary trait GWAS. We show through simulations
              that when the dimensionality of the relatedness matrix is high,
              penalized LMM and logistic regression with PC adjustment fail to
              select important predictors, and have inferior prediction
              accuracy compared to pglmm. Further, we demonstrate through the
              analysis of two polygenic binary traits in a subset of 6731
              related individuals from the UK Biobank data with 320K SNPs that
              our method can achieve higher predictive performance, while also
              selecting fewer predictors than a sparse regularized logistic

              success in the past decade. However, significant challenges still
              remain in both identifying new risk loci and interpreting
              results. Bonferroni-corrected significance level is known to be
              conservative, leading to insufficient statistical power when the
              effect size is moderate at risk locus. Complex structure of
              linkage disequilibrium also makes it challenging to separate
              causal variants from nonfunctional ones in large haplotype
              blocks. Under such circumstances, a computational approach that
              may increase signal replication rate and identify potential
              functional sites among correlated markers is urgently needed.

              that integrates genomic functional annotation and GWAS test
              statistics. The effectiveness of GenoWAP is demonstrated through
              its applications to Crohn's disease and schizophrenia using the

              substantially stronger signals in the whole dataset after

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and
              phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) involving 1 million
              GWAS samples from dozens of population-based biobanks present a
              considerable computational challenge and are carried out by large
              scientific groups under great expenditure of time and personnel.
              Automating these processes requires highly efficient and scalable
              methods and software, but so far there is no workflow solution to
              easily process 1 million GWAS samples. RESULTS: Here we present
              BIGwas, a portable, fully automated quality control and
              association testing pipeline for large-scale binary and
              quantitative trait GWAS data provided by biobank resources. By
              using Nextflow workflow and Singularity software container
              technology, BIGwas performs resource-efficient and reproducible
              analyses on a local computer or any high-performance compute
              (HPC) system with just 1 command, with no need to manually
              install a software execution environment or various software
              packages. For a single-command GWAS analysis with 974,818
              individuals and 92 million genetic markers, BIGwas takes ∼16 days
              on a small HPC system with only 7 compute nodes to perform a
              complete GWAS QC and association analysis protocol. Our dynamic
              parallelization approach enables shorter runtimes for large HPCs.
              CONCLUSIONS: Researchers without extensive bioinformatics
              knowledge and with few computer resources can use BIGwas to
              perform multi-cohort GWAS with 1 million GWAS samples and, if
              desired, use it to build their own (genome-wide) PheWAS resource.

              important, but challenging task in the broad field of genomics.
              This task is particularly difficult for non-coding DNA, the vast
              majority of which is still poorly understood in terms of
              function. A powerful predictive model for the function of
              non-coding DNA can have enormous benefit for both basic science
              and translational research because over 98\% of the human genome
              is non-coding and 93\% of disease-associated variants lie in
              these regions. To address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel
              hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory
              recurrent neural network framework for predicting non-coding
              function de novo from sequence. In the DanQ model, the
              convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, while the recurrent
              layer captures long-term dependencies between the motifs in order
              to learn a regulatory 'grammar' to improve predictions. DanQ
              improves considerably upon other models across several metrics.
              For some regulatory markers, DanQ can achieve over a 50\%

              were nearest to the sentinel variant at the investigated
              molecular QTLs, indicating that genomic proximity is the most
              reliable indicator of 'true positive' causal genes. In contrast,
              cis-gene expression QTL data led to three false positive
              candidate causal gene assignments for every one true positive
              assignment. We provide evidence that these conclusions also apply
              to other molecular phenotypes, suggesting that ProGeM is a

                 tool for understanding the biology of complex traits, but the
                 associations found rarely point directly to causal genes.
                 Here, we introduce a new method to identify the causal genes
                 by integrating GWAS summary statistics with gene expression,
                 biological pathway, and predicted protein-protein interaction
                 data. We further propose an approach that effectively
                 leverages both polygenic and locus-specific genetic signals by
                 combining results across multiple gene prioritization methods,
                 increasing confidence in prioritized genes. Using a large set
                 of gold standard genes to evaluate our approach, we prioritize
                 8,402 unique gene-trait pairs with greater than 75\% estimated

              benchmarked their ability to recover drug target genes defined
              using a combination of five drug databases. Across all traits,

              in large vertebrate genomes. With the advent of ChIP-seq
              technology, experimental detection of genome-wide EP300/CREBBP
              bound regions provides a powerful platform to develop predictive
              tools for regulatory sequences and to study their sequence
              properties. Here, we develop a support vector machine (SVM)
              framework which can accurately identify EP300-bound enhancers
              using only genomic sequence and an unbiased set of general
              sequence features. Moreover, we find that the predictive sequence
              features identified by the SVM classifier reveal biologically
              relevant sequence elements enriched in the enhancers, but we also
              identify other features that are significantly depleted in
              enhancers. The predictive sequence features are evolutionarily
              conserved and spatially clustered, providing further support of
              their functional significance. Although our SVM is trained on
              experimental data, we also predict novel enhancers and show that
              these putative enhancers are significantly enriched in both
              ChIP-seq signal and DNase I hypersensitivity signal in the mouse

              features play a role in specifying tissue-specific or
              developmental-stage-specific enhancer activity, but our results
              indicate that some features operate in a general or
              tissue-independent manner. In addition to providing a high
              confidence list of enhancer targets for subsequent experimental

              complex traits in plant and animal breeding, and increasingly in
              human genetics. The BLUP mathematical model, which consists of a
              single random effect term, was adequate when kinships were
              measured from pedigrees. However, when genome-wide SNPs are used
              to measure kinships, the BLUP model implicitly assumes that all
              SNPs have the same effect-size distribution, which is a severe
              and unnecessary limitation. We propose MultiBLUP, which extends
              the BLUP model to include multiple random effects, allowing
              greatly improved prediction when the random effects correspond to
              classes of SNPs with distinct effect-size variances. The SNP
              classes can be specified in advance, for example, based on SNP
              functional annotations, and we also provide an adaptive procedure

              who derive greater benefit from PCSK9 (proprotein convertase
              subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibition has not been established.
              METHODS: We studied 14 298 patients with atherosclerotic
              cardiovascular disease from the FOURIER trial (Further
              Cardiovascular Outcomes Researh With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects
              With Elevated Risk). A 27-single-nucleotide polymorphism genetic
              risk score defined low (quintile 1), intermediate (quintiles
              2-4), and high (quintile 5) genetic risk. Patients were also
              categorized by major atherosclerotic risk factors including
              diabetes mellitus, hypertension, low-density lipoprotein
              cholesterol $\geq$100 mg/dl, and smoking; multiple ($\geq$2) risk
              factors was considered high clinical risk. Outcomes consisted of
              major coronary events (coronary heart death, myocardial
              infarction, or coronary revascularization) and major vascular
              events (major coronary events and ischemic stroke). Median
              follow-up was 2.3 years. RESULTS: After we adjusted for clinical
              factors, the genetic risk score was associated with risk for both
              major vascular events (Ptrend=0.005) and major coronary events
              (Ptrend<0.0001). Individuals with intermediate and high genetic
              risk scores had 1.23- and 1.65-fold increased hazard for major
              coronary events, respectively. Elevated genetic risk was additive
              to major atherosclerotic risk factors and identified patients
              more likely to benefit from evolocumab. There was no benefit for
              major vascular events in patients without multiple clinical risk
              factors or high genetic risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; absolute
              risk reduction [ARR], -0.2\%, P=0.86). In contrast, there was a
              13\% relative risk reduction (HR, 0.87 [0.75-0.998], P=0.047) and
              a 1.4\% ARR in patients with multiple clinical risk factors but
              without high genetic risk and a 31\% relative risk reduction (HR,
              0.69 [0.55-0.86], P=0.0012), and 4.0\% ARR in patients with high
              genetic risk, irrespective of clinical risk (Ptrend for HR=0.017,
              ARR Ptrend=0.004). Patients with high genetic risk who received
              evolocumab had event rates similar to patients with a low burden
              of both genetic and clinical risk. CONCLUSION: Patients without
              multiple clinical risk factors or high genetic risk had a low
              event rate and did not appear to derive benefit from evolocumab
              over 2.3 years. Conversely, patients with multiple clinical risk
              factors but without high genetic risk had intermediate risk and
              intermediate risk reduction. Patients with high genetic risk,
              regardless of clinical risk, had a high event rate and derived
              the greatest relative and absolute benefit from evolocumab, which
              mitigated this risk.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: For marker effect models and genomic animal models,
              computational requirements increase with the number of loci and
              the number of genotyped individuals, respectively. In the latter
              case, the inverse genomic relationship matrix (GRM) is typically
              needed, which is computationally demanding to compute for large
              datasets. Thus, there is a great need for
              dimensionality-reduction methods that can analyze massive genomic
              data. For this purpose, we developed reduced-dimension singular
              value decomposition (SVD) based models for genomic prediction.
              METHODS: Fast SVD is performed by analyzing different
              chromosomes/genome segments in parallel and/or by restricting SVD
              to a limited core of genotyped individuals, producing chromosome-
              or segment-specific principal components (PC). Given a limited
              effective population size, nearly all the genetic variation can
              be effectively captured by a limited number of PC. Genomic
              prediction can then be performed either by PC ridge regression
              (PCRR) or by genomic animal models using an inverse GRM computed
              from the chosen PC (PCIG). In the latter case, computation of the
              inverse GRM will be feasible for any number of genotyped
              individuals and can be readily produced row- or element-wise.
              RESULTS: Using simulated data, we show that PCRR and PCIG models,
              using chromosome-wise SVD of a core sample of individuals, are
              appropriate for genomic prediction in a larger population, and
              results in virtually identical predicted breeding values as the
              original full-dimension genomic model (r = 1.000). Compared with
              other algorithms (e.g. algorithm for proven and young animals,
              APY), the (chromosome-wise SVD-based) PCRR and PCIG models were
              more robust to size of the core sample, giving nearly identical
              results even down to 500 core individuals. The method was also
              successfully tested on a large multi-breed dataset. CONCLUSIONS:
              SVD can be used for dimensionality reduction of large genomic
              datasets. After SVD, genomic prediction using dense genomic data
              and many genotyped individuals can be done in a computationally
              efficient manner. Using this method, the resulting genomic
              estimated breeding values were virtually identical to those
              computed from a full-dimension genomic model.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The largest sequence-based models of transcription
              control to date are obtained by predicting genome-wide gene
              regulatory assays across the human genome. This setting is
              fundamentally correlative, as those models are exposed during
              training solely to the sequence variation between human genes
              that arose through evolution, questioning the extent to which
              those models capture genuine causal signals. RESULTS: Here we
              confront predictions of state-of-the-art models of transcription
              regulation against data from two large-scale observational
              studies and five deep perturbation assays. The most advanced of
              these sequence-based models, Enformer, by and large, captures
              causal determinants of human promoters. However, models fail to
              capture the causal effects of enhancers on expression, notably in
              medium to long distances and particularly for highly expressed
              promoters. More generally, the predicted impact of distal
              elements on gene expression predictions is small and the ability
              to correctly integrate long-range information is significantly
              more limited than the receptive fields of the models suggest.
              This is likely caused by the escalating class imbalance between
              actual and candidate regulatory elements as distance increases.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that sequence-based models have
              advanced to the point that in silico study of promoter regions
              and promoter variants can provide meaningful insights and we
              provide practical guidance on how to use them. Moreover, we
              foresee that it will require significantly more and particularly

              variants in Danish individuals to link their in vitro phenotypes

              glucose tolerance and examined the ability of nonsynonymous
              variants to bind GLP-1 and to signal in transfected cells via
              cAMP formation and beta-arrestin recruitment. We performed a
              cross-sectional study between the burden of loss-of-signalling
              (LoS) variants and cardiometabolic phenotypes in 2,930 patients
              with type 2 diabetes and 5,712 participants in a population-based

              cardiometabolic phenotypes and the burden of the LoS variants and
              60 partly overlapping predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) GLP1R

              nonsynonymous variants in GLP1R of which 10 had a statistically
              significant loss in GLP-1-induced cAMP signalling compared to
              wildtype. However, no association was observed between the LoS
              variants and type 2 diabetes, although LoS variant carriers had a
              minor increased fasting plasma glucose level. Moreover, pLoF
              variants from the UK Biobank also did not reveal substantial
              cardiometabolic associations, despite a small effect on HbA1c.
              CONCLUSION: Since no homozygous LoS nor pLoF variants were
              identified and heterozygous carriers had similar cardiometabolic
              phenotype as non-carriers, we conclude that GLP-1R may be of

              association study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel
              insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and
              traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid
              biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the
              molecular basis of these associations. The integration of
              multiple association datasets, including gene expression
              datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel
              statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals
              are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is
              the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative
              trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be
              integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the
              approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver
              samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including
              >100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid
              biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported
              colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new
              colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal
              statistical test. In three cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs
              (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the
              eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we
              identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR, and
              KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal
              in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the
              ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary

              common complex diseases and result in the identification of novel
              drug targets. However, GWAS have also left a number of
              outstanding questions. In particular, the majority of
              disease-associated loci lie in non-coding regions of the genome
              and, even though they are thought to play a role in gene
              expression regulation, it is unclear which genes they regulate
              and in which cell types or physiological contexts this regulation
              occurs. This has hindered the translation of GWAS findings into
              clinical interventions. In this review we summarize how these
              challenges have been addressed over the last decade, with a
              particular focus on the integration of GWAS results with

              of GWAS signals with molecular phenotypes such as quantitative
              trait loci (QTLs). Finally, we highlight potential future

              SNPs while minimizing the cost of large degrees of freedom (DF)

              the sum test derived under a working assumption of a common
              association strength between the trait and each SNP, testing on
              the corresponding parameter with only one DF. Under the scenarios
              that the association strengths between the trait and the SNPs are
              close to each other (and in the same direction), as considered by
              Wang and Elston [Am. J. Hum. Genet. [2007] 80:353-360], we show
              with simulated data that the sum test was powerful as compared to
              several existing tests; otherwise, the sum test might have much
              reduced power. To overcome the limitation of the sum test, based

              demanding permutations or simulations for the Goeman test. A
              distinguishing feature of the five new tests is their use of a
              diagonal working covariance matrix, rather than a full covariance
              matrix as used in the usual Wald or score test. We recommend the
              routine use of two of the new tests, along with several other

              computationally efficient regression method to test for
              association between genetic variants (common and rare) in a

              adjusting for covariates. As a score-based variance-component

              the null model containing only the covariates, and so can easily
              be applied to genome-wide data. Using SKAT to analyze a
              genome-wide sequencing study of 1000 individuals, by segmenting

              possible to uncover both rare and common genetic variants.
              Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) can test for the effect
              of common variants, whereas sequence-based association studies
              can evaluate the cumulative effect of both rare and common
              variants on disease risk. Many groupwise association tests,
              including burden tests and variance-component tests, have been
              proposed for this purpose. Although such tests do not exclude
              common variants from their evaluation, they focus mostly on
              testing the effect of rare variants by upweighting rare-variant
              effects and downweighting common-variant effects and can
              therefore lose substantial power when both rare and common
              genetic variants in a region influence trait susceptibility.
              There is increasing evidence that the allelic spectrum of risk
              variants at a given locus might include novel, rare,
              low-frequency, and common genetic variants. Here, we introduce
              several sequence kernel association tests to evaluate the
              cumulative effect of rare and common variants. The proposed tests
              are computationally efficient and are applicable to both binary

              and whole-exome-sequencing data on the same individuals, when
              available, and are also applicable to deep-resequencing data of

              commonly used tests, including the burden and variance-component

              Recent studies have demonstrated that common diseases can be due
              to functional variants with a wide spectrum of allele
              frequencies, ranging from rare to common. An effective way to
              identify rare variants is through direct sequencing. The
              development of cost-effective sequencing technologies enables
              association studies to use sequence data from candidate genes

              powerful for analyzing rare variants, whereas multivariate

              with SNP genotyping, as genotyping studies are designed to detect
              common variants. However, studies have shown that genetic
              heterogeneity is a probable scenario for common diseases, in
              which multiple rare mutations together explain a large proportion

              example, such a group of mutations may result from resequencing a

              Using the weighted-sum method, a resequencing study can identify

               performance of various tests. The power of a given test in fact
               depends on the nature of any association and on the rareness of

              underlying genetic variants of complex human diseases. However,
              identification of genetic variants still includes difficult
              challenges, and it is important to develop powerful new
              statistical methods. Currently, association methods may depend on
              single-locus analysis--that is, analysis of the association of
              one locus, which is typically a single-nucleotide polymorphism
              (SNP), at a time--or on multilocus analysis, in which multiple
              SNPs are used to allow extraction of maximum information about
              linkage disequilibrium (LD). It has been shown that single-locus
              analysis may have low power because a single SNP often has
              limited LD information. Multilocus analysis, which is more
              informative, can be performed on the basis of either haplotypes
              or genotypes. It may lose power because of the often large number
              of degrees of freedom involved. The ideal method must make full
              use of important information from multiple loci but avoid
              increasing the degrees of freedom. Therefore, we propose a method
              to capture information from multiple SNPs but with the use of
              fewer degrees of freedom. When a set of SNPs in a block are
              correlated because of LD, we might expect that the genotype
              variation among the different phenotypic groups would extend
              across all the SNPs, and this information could be compressed
              into the low-frequency components of a Fourier transform.
              Therefore, we develop a test based on weighted Fourier
              transformation coefficients, with more weight given to the
              low-frequency components. Our simulation results demonstrate the
              validity and substantially higher power of the proposed method
              compared with other common methods. This method provides an

              case-control ratios, and this can cause inflation of type I error
              rates. Recently, a saddle point approximation (SPA) based
              single-variant test has been developed to provide an accurate and
              scalable method to test for associations of such phenotypes. For
              gene- or region-based multiple-variant tests, a few methods exist
              that can adjust for unbalanced case-control ratios; however,
              these methods are either less accurate when case-control ratios
              are extremely unbalanced or not scalable for large data analyses.
              To address these problems, we propose SKAT- and SKAT-O- type
              region-based tests; in these tests, the single-variant score
              statistic is calibrated based on SPA and efficient resampling
              (ER). Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed
              method provides well-calibrated p values. In contrast, when the
              case-control ratio is 1:99, the unadjusted approach has greatly
              inflated type I error rates (90 times that of exome-wide

              high-throughput sequencing platforms have made it possible for
              researchers to generate comprehensive information on rare
              variants in large samples. We provide a general framework for
              association testing with rare variants by combining mutation
              information across multiple variant sites within a gene and
              relating the enriched genetic information to disease phenotypes
              through appropriate regression models. Our framework covers all
              major study designs (i.e., case-control, cross-sectional, cohort
              and family studies) and all common phenotypes (e.g., binary,
              quantitative, and age at onset), and it allows arbitrary
              covariates (e.g., environmental factors and ancestry variables).

              biological scenarios. The allele-frequency threshold can be fixed

               randomisation approach. SETTING: 25 cohorts from Europe, United
               States, east Asia, and Australia with genome wide genotyping and
               fracture data. PARTICIPANTS: A discovery set of 37 857 fracture
               cases and 227 116 controls; with replication in up to 147 200
               fracture cases and 150 085 controls. Fracture cases were defined
               as individuals (>18 years old) who had fractures at any skeletal
               site confirmed by medical, radiological, or questionnaire
               reports. Instrumental variable analyses were performed to
               estimate effects of 15 selected clinical risk factors for
               fracture in a two-sample mendelian randomisation framework,
               using the largest previously published GWAS meta-analysis of
               each risk factor. RESULTS: Of 15 fracture associated loci
               identified, all were also associated with bone mineral density
               and mapped to genes clustering in pathways known to be critical
               to bone biology (eg, SOST, WNT16, and ESR1) or novel pathways
               (FAM210A, GRB10, and ETS2). Mendelian randomisation analyses
               showed a clear effect of bone mineral density on fracture risk.
               One standard deviation decrease in genetically determined bone
               mineral density of the femoral neck was associated with a 55\%
               increase in fracture risk (odds ratio 1.55 (95\% confidence
               interval 1.48 to 1.63; P=1.5$\times$10-68). Hand grip strength
               was inversely associated with fracture risk, but this result was
               not significant after multiple testing correction. The remaining
               clinical risk factors (including vitamin D levels) showed no
               evidence for an effect on fracture. CONCLUSIONS: This large
               scale GWAS meta-analysis for fracture identified 15 genetic
               determinants of fracture, all of which also influenced bone
               mineral density. Among the clinical risk factors for fracture
               assessed, only bone mineral density showed a major causal effect
               on fracture. Genetic predisposition to lower levels of vitamin D

              polymorphisms (SNPs) as IVs to disentangle the causal
              relationship between an exposure and an outcome. Since any causal
              conclusion critically depends on the three valid IV assumptions,
              which will likely be violated in practice, MR methods robust to
              the IV assumptions are greatly needed. As such a method, Egger
              regression stands out as one of the most widely used due to its
              easy use and perceived robustness. Although Egger regression is
              claimed to be robust to directional pleiotropy under the
              instrument strength independent of direct effect (InSIDE)
              assumption, it is known to be dependent on the
              orientations/coding schemes of SNPs (i.e. which allele of an SNP
              is selected as the reference group). The current practice, as
              recommended as the default setting in some popular MR software
              packages, is to orientate the SNPs to be all positively
              associated with the exposure, which however, to our knowledge,
              has not been fully studied to assess its robustness and potential
              impact. We use both numerical examples (with both real data and
              simulated data) and analytical results to demonstrate the
              practical problem of Egger regression with respect to its heavy
              dependence on the SNP orientations. Under the assumption that
              InSIDE holds for some specific (and unknown) coding scheme of the
              SNPs, we analytically show that other coding schemes would in
              general lead to the violation of InSIDE. Other related MR and IV
              regression methods may suffer from the same problem. Cautions
              should be taken when applying Egger regression (and related MR
              and IV regression methods) in practice.",

               randomization (MR) study to evaluate whether genetically lowered
               vitamin D level influences the risk of MS. METHODS AND FINDINGS:
               We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated
               with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level from SUNLIGHT, the
               largest (n = 33,996) genome-wide association study to date for
               vitamin D. Four SNPs were genome-wide significant for 25OHD
               level (p-values ranging from 6 $\times$ 10-10 to 2 $\times$
               10-109), and all four SNPs lay in, or near, genes strongly
               implicated in separate mechanisms influencing 25OHD. We then
               ascertained their effect on 25OHD level in 2,347 participants
               from a population-based cohort, the Canadian Multicentre
               Osteoporosis Study, and tested the extent to which the
               25OHD-decreasing alleles explained variation in 25OHD level. We
               found that the count of 25OHD-decreasing alleles across these
               four SNPs was strongly associated with lower 25OHD level (n =
               2,347, F-test statistic = 49.7, p = 2.4 $\times$ 10-12). Next,
               we conducted an MR study to describe the effect of genetically
               lowered 25OHD on the odds of MS in the International Multiple
               Sclerosis Genetics Consortium study, the largest genetic
               association study to date for MS (including up to 14,498 cases
               and 24,091 healthy controls). Alleles were weighted by their
               relative effect on 25OHD level, and sensitivity analyses were
               performed to test MR assumptions. MR analyses found that each
               genetically determined one-standard-deviation decrease in
               log-transformed 25OHD level conferred a 2.0-fold increase in the
               odds of MS (95\% CI: 1.7-2.5; p = 7.7 $\times$ 10-12; I2 = 63\%,
               95\% CI: 0\%-88\%). This result persisted in sensitivity
               analyses excluding SNPs possibly influenced by population
               stratification or pleiotropy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95\% CI:
               1.3-2.2; p = 2.3 $\times$ 10-5; I2 = 47\%, 95\% CI: 0\%-85\%)
               and including only SNPs involved in 25OHD synthesis or
               metabolism (ORsynthesis = 2.1, 95\% CI: 1.6-2.6, p = 1 $\times$
               10-9; ORmetabolism = 1.9, 95\% CI: 1.3-2.7, p = 0.002). While
               these sensitivity analyses decreased the possibility that
               pleiotropy may have biased the results, residual pleiotropy is
               difficult to exclude entirely. CONCLUSIONS: A genetically
               lowered 25OHD level is strongly associated with increased
               susceptibility to MS. Whether vitamin D sufficiency can delay,
               or prevent, MS onset merits further investigation in long-term

               can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope
               coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the
               causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each
               genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the
               pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure),
               Egger's test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis
               and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the
               genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables. RESULTS: We
               illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two
               published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect
               of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood
               pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative
               nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples.
               CONCLUSIONS: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call
               MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard
               instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect
               estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach
               provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the
               findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: When analyzing data from large-scale genetic
              association studies, such as targeted or genome-wide resequencing
              studies, it is common to assume a single genetic model, such as
              dominant or additive, for all tests of association between a
              given genetic variant and the phenotype. However, for many
              variants, the chosen model will result in poor model fit and may
              lack statistical power due to model misspecification. OBJECTIVE:
              We develop power and sample size calculations for tests of gene
              and gene $\times$ environment interaction, allowing for
              misspecification of the true mode of genetic susceptibility.
              METHODS: The power calculations are based on a likelihood ratio
              test framework and are implemented in an open-source R package
              (``genpwr''). RESULTS: We use these methods to develop an
              analysis plan for a resequencing study in idiopathic pulmonary
              fibrosis and show that using a 2-degree of freedom test can
              increase power to detect recessive genetic effects while
              maintaining power to detect dominant and additive effects.
              CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the impact of model misspecification
              can aid in study design and developing analysis plans that
              maximize power to detect a range of true underlying genetic
              effects. In particular, these calculations help identify when a
              multiple degree of freedom test or other robust test of
              association may be advantageous.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence that rare variants play
              a role in some complex traits, but their analysis is not
              straightforward. Locus-based tests become necessary due to low
              power in rare variant single-point association analyses. In
              addition, variant quality scores are available for sequencing
              data, but are rarely taken into account. Here, we propose two
              locus-based methods that incorporate variant quality scores: a
              regression-based collapsing approach and an allele-matching
              method. METHODS: Using simulated sequencing data we compare 4
              locus-based tests of trait association under different scenarios
              of data quality. We test two collapsing-based approaches and two
              allele-matching-based approaches, taking into account variant
              quality scores and ignoring variant quality scores. We implement
              the collapsing and allele-matching approaches accounting for
              variant quality in the freely available ARIEL and AMELIA
              software. RESULTS: The incorporation of variant quality scores in
              locus-based association tests has power advantages over weighting
              each variant equally. The allele-matching methods are robust to
              the presence of both protective and risk variants in a locus,
              while collapsing methods exhibit a dramatic loss of power in this
              scenario. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of variant quality
              scores should be a standard protocol when performing locus-based
              association analysis on sequencing data. The ARIEL and AMELIA
              software implement collapsing and allele-matching locus
              association analysis methods, respectively, that allow the

  abstract  = "Summary Background Randomised trials of vitamin D
               supplementation for cardiovascular disease and all-cause
               mortality have generally reported null findings. However,
               generalisability of results to individuals with low vitamin D
               status is unclear. We aimed to characterise dose-response
               relationships between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D)
               concentrations and risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and
               all-cause mortality in observational and Mendelian randomisation
               frameworks. Methods Observational analyses were undertaken using
               data from 33 prospective studies comprising 500 962 individuals
               with no known history of coronary heart disease or stroke at
               baseline. Mendelian randomisation analyses were performed in
               four population-based cohort studies (UK Biobank, EPIC-CVD, and
               two Copenhagen population-based studies) comprising 386 406
               middle-aged individuals of European ancestries, including 33 546
               people who developed coronary heart disease, 18 166 people who
               had a stroke, and 27 885 people who died. Primary outcomes were
               coronary heart disease, defined as fatal ischaemic heart disease
               (International Classification of Diseases 10th revision code
               I20-I25) or non-fatal myocardial infarction (I21-I23); stroke,
               defined as any cerebrovascular disease (I60-I69); and all-cause
               mortality. Findings Observational analyses suggested inverse
               associations between incident coronary heart disease, stroke,
               and all-cause mortality outcomes with 25(OH)D concentration at
               low 25(OH)D concentrations. In population-wide genetic analyses,
               there were no associations of genetically-predicted 25(OH)D with
               coronary heart disease, stroke, or all-cause mortality. However,
               for the participants with vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D
               concentration <25 nmol/L), genetic analyses provided strong
               evidence for an inverse association with all-cause mortality
               (odds ratio [OR] per 10 nmol/L increase in genetically-predicted
               25[OH]D concentration 0·69 [95\% CI 0·59--0·80]; p<0·0001) and
               non-significant inverse associations for stroke (0·85
               [0·70--1·02], p=0·09) and coronary heart disease (0·89
               [0·76--1·04]; p=0·14). A finer stratification of participants
               found inverse associations between genetically-predicted 25(OH)D
               concentrations and all-cause mortality up to around 40 nmol/L.
               Interpretation Stratified Mendelian randomisation analyses
               suggest a causal relationship between 25(OH)D concentrations and
               mortality for individuals with low vitamin D status. Our

  abstract = "Mendelian randomization (MR) is a burgeoning field that involves
              the use of genetic variants to assess causal relationships
              between exposures and outcomes. MR studies can be
              straightforward; for example, genetic variants within or near the
              encoding locus that is associated with protein concentrations can
              help to assess their causal role in disease. However, a more
              complex relationship between the genetic variants and an exposure
              can make findings from MR more difficult to interpret. In this
              Review, we describe some of these challenges in interpreting MR
              analyses, including those from studies using genetic variants to
              assess causality of multiple traits (such as branched-chain amino
              acids and risk of diabetes mellitus); studies describing
              pleiotropic variants (for example, C-reactive protein and its

  abstract = "We consider in this paper detection of signal regions associated
              with disease outcomes in whole genome association studies. Gene-
              or region-based methods have become increasingly popular in whole
              genome association analysis as a complementary approach to
              traditional individual variant analysis. However, these methods
              test for the association between an outcome and the genetic
              variants in a pre-specified region, e.g., a gene. In view of
              massive intergenic regions in whole genome sequencing (WGS)
              studies, we propose a computationally efficient quadratic scan
              (Q-SCAN) statistic based method to detect the existence and the
              locations of signal regions by scanning the genome continuously.
              The proposed method accounts for the correlation (linkage
              disequilibrium) among genetic variants, and allows for signal
              regions to have both causal and neutral variants, and the effects
              of signal variants to be in different directions. We study the
              asymptotic properties of the proposed Q-SCAN statistics. We
              derive an empirical threshold that controls for the family-wise
              error rate, and show that under regularity conditions the
              proposed method consistently selects the true signal regions. We
              perform simulation studies to evaluate the finite sample
              performance of the proposed method. Our simulation results show
              that the proposed procedure outperforms the existing methods,
              especially when signal regions have causal variants whose effects
              are in different directions, or are contaminated with neutral
              variants. We illustrate Q-SCAN by analyzing the WGS data from the
              Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.",

  abstract = "In a genetic association study, it is often desirable to perform
              an overall test of whether any or all single-nucleotide
              polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene are associated with a phenotype.
              Several such tests exist, but most of them are powerful only
              under very specific assumptions about the genetic effects of the
              individual SNPs. In addition, some of the existing tests assume
              that the direction of the effect of each SNP is known, which is a
              highly unlikely scenario. Here, we propose a new kernel-based
              association test of joint association of several SNPs. Our test
              is non-parametric and robust, and does not make any assumption
              about the directions of individual SNP effects. It can be used to
              test multiple correlated SNPs within a gene and can also be used
              to test independent SNPs or genes in a biological pathway. Our
              test uses an analysis of variance paradigm to compare variation
              between cases and controls to the variation within the groups.
              The variation is measured using kernel functions for each marker,
              and then a composite statistic is constructed to combine the
              markers into a single test. We present simulation results
              comparing our statistic to the U-statistic-based method by Schaid
              et al. ([2005] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 76:780-793) and another
              statistic by Wessel and Schork ([2006] Am. J. Hum. Genet.
              79:792-806). We consider a variety of different disease models
              and assumptions about how many SNPs within the gene are actually
              associated with disease. Our results indicate that our statistic
              has higher power than other statistics under most realistic

              rare variants are being developed. Methods in which variants are
              grouped for analysis are also known as variant-set, gene-based,
              and aggregate unit tests. The burden test and sequence kernel
              association test (SKAT) are two widely used variant-set tests,
              which were originally developed for samples of unrelated
              individuals and later have been extended to family data with
              known pedigree structures. However, computationally efficient and
              powerful variant-set tests are needed to make analyses tractable
              in large-scale WGS studies with complex study samples. In this
              paper, we propose the variant-set mixed model association tests
              (SMMAT) for continuous and binary traits using the generalized
              linear mixed model framework. These tests can be applied to
              large-scale WGS studies involving samples with population

              and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)
              program. SMMATs share the same null model for different variant
              sets, and a virtue of this null model, which includes covariates
              only, is that it needs to be fit only once for all tests in each
              genome-wide analysis. Simulation studies show that all the
              proposed SMMATs correctly control type I error rates for both
              continuous and binary traits in the presence of population
              structure and relatedness. We also illustrate our tests in a real

  abstract  = "Most findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are
               consistent with a simple disease model at a single nucleotide
               polymorphism, in which each additional copy of the risk allele
               increases risk by the same multiplicative factor, in contrast to
               dominance or interaction effects. As others have noted,
               departures from this multiplicative model are difficult to
               detect. Here, we seek to quantify this both analytically and
               empirically. We show that imperfect linkage disequilibrium (LD)
               between causal and marker loci distorts disease models, with the
               power to detect such departures dropping off very quickly:
               decaying as a function of r4, where r2 is the usual correlation
               between the causal and marker loci, in contrast to the
               well-known result that power to detect a multiplicative effect
               decays as a function of r2. We perform a simulation study with
               empirical patterns of LD to assess how this disease model
               distortion is likely to impact GWAS results. Among loci where
               association is detected, we observe that there is reasonable
               power to detect substantial deviations from the multiplicative
               model, such as for dominant and recessive models. Thus, it is
               worth explicitly testing for such deviations routinely.",
